# Evo-Autonom-Driving


We at [Smartfactor - TU Graz](https://www.smartfactory.tugraz.at/index.html) are working on dynamically reconfigurable automated assembly lines.

For this application symmetric machining tables are used, each housing a different machine.
Depending on the work piece that should be created, these tables should be assembled in the most optimal configuration, to ensure efficency of the worker-robot that uses them.

Currently arrangment of these tables is done by teleoperating our [shuttle-robot](https://evocortex.org/products/evorobot/).

This repository aims at providing a plug-and-play solution, to make our robot drive inside one specific table.

For a complete explaination take a look at my bachelor thesis: -alksjdf-
